# Inspiration
As Computer Science students, we spend tons of time focused on our laptop screens, leading to incorrect posture habits that accumulate over time. Since many other participants in this hackathon are in the same situation as us, we were inspired to create software that can help reinforce correct posture when working on your laptop.

# What it does
Posturite is a live camera detection app that scans your posture while at your computer, telling you what you need to fix. It helps users who are often challenger by bad posture while on their computers stay healthy while working for extended periods of time.

# How we built it
We built posturite with OpenCV and MediaPipe. We used OpenCV to build our front end of the desktop app, and used MediaPipe for joint detection to build our algorithm for the posture detection and fixes.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of successfully implementing an algorithm that detects how close a user is to the webcam to detect slouching

# What we learned
1. Tkinter frontend framework
2. Implementing and utilizing computer vision
4. Collaborative software design
